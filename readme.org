* adc: agares deployment core
this was spun out of agares (which has sense been deprecated) to keep my machine setup bullshit separate from deploys and small docker-compose files not deserving of their own repo.

** ansible
houses ansible roles

*** arke
    - deploys monitoring script
    - its mostly broken.
    - relies on droplet config

*** mojobot
    - deploy mojobot
    - two portions; web and rtm client.
    - relies on droplet config

*** znc
    - deploys znc bouncer
    - relies on external drive attached to droplet
    - relies on droplet config

*** awfulAll
    - deploy mojobot
    - deploy znc
    - deploy arke
    - relies on droplet config

*** droplets
    - add regular user, sudo group, add user to group
    - use local droplet key
    - disable pw auth for root
    - update apt and install req packages
    - restart sshd service.

*** onprem
    - configure aptitude
    - add docker key, repo
    - install req packages
    - add my user to docker group.

*** splunk_servers
    - remnent of a past job
    - i don't believe ever worked
    - here for historical purposes.

*** wg_vpn
** docker
houses small dockerfiles / dockercompose stuff.
*** mediaserver
    - docker compose file
    - sonarr (tv)
    - radarr (movie)
    - lidarr (music)
    - sabnzb (dl manager)
    - lazylibrarian (this sucks and doesn't really work)
** scripts
houses small scripts that i used to use before i moved to ansible for most things. these should probably all get deleted or converted to ansible roles.

*** mac-client
    - set up brew
    - install req packages

*** win-client
    - install packages through chocolatey
    - disable a bunch of default shit.

*** nix
    - add repos
    - download key to install pscore
    - update apt and install packages
    - automatically create userchrome.css file/dir for ff

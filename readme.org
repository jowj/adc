* adc: agares deployment core
this was spun out of agares (which has sense been deprecated) to keep my machine setup bullshit separate from deploys and small docker-compose files not deserving of their own repo.

** ansible
houses ansible roles

** docker
houses small dockerfiles / dockercompose stuff.

** scripts
houses small scripts that i used to use before i moved to ansible for most things. these should probably all get rewritten.

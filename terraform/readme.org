* Overview
The TF module of ~ADC~ inits machine creation in ~Bikeshed~, my local proxmox cluster, and configures DNS for my projects. Or at least, that's the goal. Right now i'm mostly just experimenting with it.

The idea is to keep ansible for configuration and use TF for machine creation / API communication.

* Using this
- Install ~Terraform~
- Move into the directory related to what you want to work on
- ~terraform plan~
- ~terraform apply~

* Stuff to figure out
- State. Using local tf state is mostly reasonable for a personal project, but since I want it to host more of my infra in general I may need to come up with a better solution. Unfortunately, tf state includes secrets for some fucking reason, and that means I need to be careful about where I put the dumb thing.
- Importing. Right now, resources exist outside the context of TF, and the story for getting things like DNS moved to TF is fucking awful, somehow? why does this suck so bad.
